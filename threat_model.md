Thread Model of Email system

If you wanted to send an email to all the customers, there are a few key pieces of security that you want to keep in mind. The first step when creating an account with an email provider is choosing a password that is secure. I suggest using a "passphrase" which includes a set of 5 random words, with spaces included. This type of a password drastically increases the time it would take to brute force attack the password. Another important factor would be who you give access to the administrator password. I think you should keep this limited as possible. The passphrase is something that should never be written down or stored in clear text and its best that is memorized. A few other helpful hints would be changing your passphrase every 60-90 days, and enabling 2Factor authentication which would prevent anyone from logging onto the account without a verification code sent via text message. I would also suggest to never log into this account from a computer that is not your own, or from a network that you do not privately control. As these are common ways that hackers are able to "sniff" out your actives and possibly gain access to your account. It is important to always keep security in mind. Often times its people that are the closest to you, who also know the most about you, who may try to sabotage your success.
