# Example Threat Model

## Scenario

#### For a brief period I worked for a major cable company (that may or may not rhyme with bombast),  managing a team in one of their call centers. Yes, it was the most miserable job I've ever had and I realize that if you're reading this and you've ever tried to cancel their services you probably hate me now. Despite that fact, I'll press on. As terrifying as this may seem, this type of environment generally features employees with a very low level of technical knowledge who have access to a staggering amount of sensitive customer info. So away we go!

## Email

####    I think we need to address potential threats to our customer data. The most likely vector for security breaches would be our own employees. Our employees are typically hired based off sales ability as opposed to techincal savvy, and due to our software suite, could be vulnerable to both social engineering and malware/electronic hacking. We handle very sensitive customer data(SSN, credit card #s, etc.), as well as proprietary company info(customer usage data, physical asset info, etc.), which are vulnerable to partys who could use that info to their gain.

####    Given that our employees utilize a customer chat system, a phone system with limited caller screening, and frequently use their company email for customer interaction, their are multiple methods by which a potential threat could gain access to protected data. We need to ensure that our employees are trained in common methods of social engineering to prevent data loss, as well as making sure that our internal email and chat system do an adequate job of filtering incoming customer users to the appropriate channels(i.e. new users go directly to new sales, where employees don't have access to existing customer data).
