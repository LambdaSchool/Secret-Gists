Think of another threat model, and write a summary of it as if you were going to send it as a professional email to explain it to a coworker. Suggested ~1-2 paragraphs length, and addressing the core concepts (adversaries, attack surface and vector, and what sort of specific attacks and risks the user faces).


Threat: Compromised User
Note: Do not consider any computer system to be invulnerable. Your computer is vulnerable too, for example, it can contain malware or hardware Trojan.

Three ways to mitigate this threat:
1) Use a hardened/well tested Operating System.
2) Use antivirus software. It will not provide complete protection, but it will decrease probability of being infected by malware.
3) Always update all software! Do not disable software auto-update, or an attacker may be able to exploit legitimate software to gain access to your data.
