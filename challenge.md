// Think of a threat model. 


Dear Co-Worker,

As you know we work with highly sensitive data at DataCorp. As you have seen with other members of our market space we are a constant target for hackers around the world. Now it is especailly important to understand and address our vaulnerability.

As you know we have a threat tested technology core and would be near impossible to brute force attack. Our main weakness is with our teams access to data within the organization. To address this we are instituting a layered system to access to our network interally. 
There will be 5 levels of access. Only our most senior staff will have level 1. Most of the team will be at level 5. With a specific avenue of escalation and an audit trail for any access at all. With our new protocol we plan to enable a safe environment for our sensitive data.
