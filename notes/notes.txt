Use OAuth to get a token via a callback url and then use that
token to make calls to the facebook API to get their use data until the token
expires. Websites rely on it because it allows programmers to access their data without 
the user having to directly disclose their information and spread their credentials around
online but still provide a level of protection to the data. 

AUTHORIZES BUT DOES NOT AUTHENTICATE

The process in which a website obtains a token is called a flow, and in the OAuth flow, 
there are three key players: the user, the consumer, and the service provider.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the https://api.github.com. All data is sent
and received as JSON.
