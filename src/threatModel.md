Prompt:
    Think of another threat model, and write a summary of it as if you were going to send it as a progfessional email to explain it to a coworker. Suggested 1-2 paragraphs langth, and addressing the core concepts (adversaries, attack surface and vector, and what sort of specific attacks and risks the user faces)

Response:

        Our goal in the Threat Model are to identify potential threats to our "Secret Gist" project.
        Determining our Threat Model is a matter of breaking down our application to understand what is available to our users, determining what would be a potential target for evil-doers and finally determining our countermeasures for said dangers.

        My immediate concerns regarding "Secret Gist" is that currently, the app does not set a
        limit on how many gists the user can open. This leaves our application vulnerable to spam attacks and can be solved by implementing a gist submission timeout. Another thought is that, in event that someone other than the user gets their hands on the user's device or if the user steps away. In this case I think it would be wise to be considerate not to make it inconvenient or bothersome for the intended user. I think an inactivity timer set to something like 5 minutes(?) with a simple pin unlock would be one solution. 

        Please let me know your thoughts on possible threats and the solutions I've offered. 

        Also if you have any questions on the matter please feel free to contact me. :)
