Challenge
Think of another threat model, and write a summary of it as if you were going to send it as a professional email to explain it to a coworker. Suggested ~1-2 paragraphs length, and addressing the core concepts (adversaries, attack surface and vector, and what sort of specific attacks and risks the user faces).

Hello John Co-worker,   I am writing you this email to discuss how we can best secure our sensitive files from would be hackers.  Since most of our adversaries are likely outside of this country, we mostly have to worry about digital attacks.  To help mitigate this issue we should force all employees to have very secure passwords.  I would suggest that each employee should use a password manager, we will be making one avaiable on our network.  Each employee should memorize a nonsencial sentence to use as their key.  Every other password should be at least a 20 character randomized string.  Passwords to items over the internet will deploy a 2 stage authorization, using either our password app or a trusted source like Google.

All peripheal devies like, external hard drives and thumbdrives will need to be plugged into a non networked PC and scanned before they can be used within the office.  Our most sensitive information will also be kept off of the internet and will only be availble within the internal network.

If we follow these guildlines, we can mitigate the threat from foreign agents.

Yours truley, Jack b Co-worker.
