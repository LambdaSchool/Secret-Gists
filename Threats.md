Threat: Remote Workers
  As more employees are being authorized to work from home, a greater number of remote connected and employee supplied devices are accessing data with great potential for data breaches to occur.

Devices:
  Mobile Phones/Tablets -> Employee owned
  Laptops -> Supplied by employer

  With the mobile devices being owned by the employees, we have little control over the security of these devices. 

  Recommend new employee owned device policy for remote workers: 
    1. Employees must have a lock on their devices (biometric or password) that automatically locks the device.
      A. Recommendation that Remote Wipe policy be instituted and implemented for protection against device theft
    2. Employees must register the device with IT for two factor authentication.
      A. IT to collect MAC addresses for device registration/authentication
    3. Remote access to email must be set to timeout after 15 minutes of device inactivity.

  Update policy for remote workers with Company supplied laptops:
    1. IT to install VPN connections
      First round recommendations for further eval by IT:
        A. TunnelBear - 5 connections per user, recent security audit, remote kill built in
        B. VyprVPN - dedicated cloud server integrates with our existing cloud services, high speed connection, remote kill built in
        C. SaferVPN - available on all devices, management console, remote kill built in, 5 devices per user
        D. NordVPN - two server encryption, remote kill built in, 6 connections per user
    2. Employees with access to high security data must  be provided with an RSA SecurID fob.
